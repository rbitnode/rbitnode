## Hi there 👋
I'm Rajesh,

Software engineer by passion, Software engineer by profession. 💻

From discovering C++ in grade 11 to mastering the art of software engineering, my journey has been fueled by curiosity and resilience. Over time, I have grown from writing hello-world's to understanding the full lifecycle of software development, from requirement planning to seamless deployment. During life’s toughest moments, it’s my passion for problem-solving and the algorithms running ceaselessly in my mind that keep me grounded and driven.

When I imagine myself in the distant future, I see a small room, the clock reading 3 a.m., the glow of a screen reflecting my relentless pursuit of solutions. It’s in these quiet hours, fueled by algorithms and determination, that I find my true self — a creator, a thinker, and a problem-solver, navigating life with the same logic and persistence I bring to code. I’m not just a coder; I’m a builder of solutions and a lifelong learner in the ever-evolving world of technology.

If you are also like me, cheers to you, me and the future we are building together. 🍻
